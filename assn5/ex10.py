# Take all functions from assignment 4, exercise 11 and copy them here, modifying
# them so they return a value instead of printing it.
#
# Next, add doctests to the is_material_implication() and is_exclusive_disjunction()
# functions. There should be 4 tests for each function (False/False, False/True, etc.).
# Consult the Venn diagrams when determining the correct result for each test case:
# http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_function#Table_of_binary_truth_functions
#
# Finally, correct any errors revealed by the test cases.


# Add functions here.
